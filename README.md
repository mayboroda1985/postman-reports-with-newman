# API testing framework using Postman, Newman, and Node.js to automate validation of RESTful APIs across multiple environments (QA, staging)

*Created modular test scripts using Bash, allowing users to run different collections (e.g., acceptance tests) with specific environment configurations through CLI.
*Integrated HTML reporting using Newman and the htmlextra reporter, providing detailed test reports with dynamic build numbers and environment details.
*Implemented version control using GitHub for collaboration and seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines, enabling automated test execution and HTML reporting through GitHub Actions.


## Installation

Clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/postman-reports-with-newman.git
cd postman-automated-tests
npm install
npm install newman-reporter-htmlextra --save


**## Directory Structure**
Ensure your directory structure matches the following:
/project-root
|-- collections/
|   |-- restfull_booker_collection.json
|   |-- 1_collection.json
|   |-- 2_collection.json
|-- environments/
|   |-- local_environment.json
|   |-- prod_environment.json
|   |-- qa1_environment.json
|   |-- qa2_environment.json
|   |-- qa3_environment.json
|   |-- staging_environment.json
|-- reports/
|-- run_tests.sh


**## Check Script Permissions**
Ensure that the script has the correct permissions and is executable:
chmod +x run_tests.sh

**## To run Reports with specific env and specific collection through bash** , runs on background and not showing on terminal
./run_tests.sh staging restfull_booker_collection 


**##  To run Reports with specific env and specific collection through bash** , runs on background and not showing on terminal
newman run collections/restfull_booker_collection.json -e environments/prod_environment.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export "reports/report_restfull_booker_collection.html"

newman run collections/1_collection.json -e environments/qa1_environment.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export "reports/report_1_collection.html"

newman run collections/2_collection.json -e environments/qa2_environment.json -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export "reports/report_2_collection.html"

**##Install .dotenv**
npm install dotenv


**##To run from JS file**
 node run_tests.js collections/1_collection.json /environments/qa1_environment.json

**## To run tests from package.json**
change  line 7 to:

npm run test:prodAcceptance
npm run test:localCollectionPositive
npm run test:qa1CollectionNegative

**# Run Newman with the selected environment and collection files in command line**
newman run "$COLLECTION_FILE" -e "$ENV_FILE"--reporters cli,htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export "$REPORT_FILE"

# Run Newman with the selected environment and collection files without command line
newman run "$COLLECTION_FILE" -e "$ENV_FILE" -r htmlextra --reporter-htmlextra-export "$REPORT_FILE"

 # About run_tests.sh file

the #!/bin/bash file (run_tests.sh) is designed to run different collections such as collections/1_collection.json or collections/2_collection.json. Here's how it works:

##How it handles different collections:
* The script expects the environment (like qa6, qa4, etc.) as the first argument.
* It expects the collection name (like restfull_booker_collection, 1_collection, or 2_collection) as the second argument.
* Key Lines in the Script:
# Check if a specific collection is provided as the second argument
if [ -n "$2" ]; then
    COLLECTION=$2
else
    COLLECTION="restfull_booker_collection"  # Default collection if none provided
fi

COLLECTION_FILE="collections/${COLLECTION}.json"

This logic works as follows:

* If you provide a second argument (for example, 2_collection), it will use collections/2_collection.json as the collection file.
* If no collection is specified, it will default to collections/restfull_booker_collection.json.

Example Usage:
To run the restfull_booker_negative_collection collection in the qa6 environment:
./run_tests.sh qa6 restfull_booker_negative_collection

This will:

Use the environments/qa6_environment.json file.
Use the collections/restfull_booker_negative_collection.json file.
To run the restfull_booker_negative_collection collection in the qa5 environment:
./run_tests.sh qa5 restfull_booker_negative_collection

This will:

Use the environments/qa5_environment.json file.
Use the collections/restfull_booker_negative_collection.json file.
Default Collection:
If no second argument (collection name) is provided, it will default to restfull_booker_collection.
./run_tests.sh qa6

This will:

Use environments/qa6_environment.json.
Use the default collections/restfull_booker_collection.json.
Conclusion:
The script is designed to be flexible and run different collections by simply passing the collection name as the second argument. If you don't specify one, it will fall back to the default collection (restfull_booker_collection.json).


##Set Up GitHub Actions workflow:

Newman Runner
To see the runner working, we'll go back into our newly created GitHub repo this time in GitHub itself.

Select the root file path in master and click "Add file", "Create new file".

GitHub will only look for Actions which are stored under the following file path so make sure you enter the structure exactly.

Firstly, we type .github and then forward slash /.

After that, we type workflows/, then give our file a name ending in .yml, which is the correct format for an actions file.


**##Resolve github conflics in VSCODE terminal**
    
    If Github doesn't let you resolve conflicts there it means there are too many changes and then you can resolve conflicts in your visual studio
    
    1. you need to be in to your branch in VSCode : ex. **fixed-api/Updated-collection**
    2. pull from the base branch
    
    **git pull origin `<base_branch_name>` ex. git pull origin RC_30.1.0**
    
    1. git config pull.rebase false
    2.  git pull origin RC_10.1.0
    3. In VSCode on the left side you will see in red changes that required in each file
    4. Go through each one and after commit
    5. Confirm that all changes are done in GitHub Desktop
